#' @param text a character vector or connection. Test corpus from which 
#' language model perplexity is computed.
#' @param model either an object of class \code{language_model}, or a 
#' \code{kgram_freqs} object. The language model from which probabilities 
#' are computed.
#' @param .preprocess a function taking a character vector as input and 
#' returning a character vector as output. Preprocessing transformation  
#' applied to input before computing perplexity.
#' @param .tknz_sent a function taking a character vector as input and 
#' returning a character vector as output. Optional sentence tokenization step
#' applied before computing perplexity.
#' @param batch_size a length one positive integer or \code{NULL}.
#' Size of text batches when reading text from a \code{connection}. 
#' If \code{NULL}, all input text is processed in a single batch.
#' @param ... further arguments passed to or from other methods.
#' @return a number. Perplexity of the language model on the test corpus.
#' 
#' @details
#' These generic functions are used to compute a \code{language_model} 
#' perplexity on a test corpus, which may be either a plain character vector 
#' of text, or a connection from which text can be read in batches. 
#' The second option is useful if one wants to avoid loading 
#' the full text in physical memory, and allows to process text from 
#' different sources such as files, compressed files or URLs.
#' 
#' "Perplexity" is defined here, following Ref. 
#' \insertCite{chen1999empirical}{kgrams}, as the exponential of the normalized 
#' language model cross-entropy with the test corpus. Cross-entropy is
#' normalized by the total number of words in the corpus, where we include
#' the End-Of-Sentence tokens, but not the Begin-Of-Sentence tokens, in the
#' word count.
#' 
#' The custom .preprocess and .tknz_sent arguments allow to apply
#' transformations to the text corpus before the perplexity computation takes
#' place. By default, the same functions used during model building are 
#' employed, c.f. \link[kgrams]{kgram_freqs} and \link[kgrams]{language_model}.
#' 
#' A note of caution is in order. Perplexity is not defined for all language
#' models available in \link[kgrams]{kgrams}. For instance, smoother 
#' \code{"sbo"} (i.e. Stupid Backoff \insertCite{brants-etal-2007-large}{kgrams}) 
#' does not produce normalized probabilities,
#' and this is signaled by a warning (shown once per session) if the user 
#' attempts to compute the perplexity for such a model. 
#' In these cases, when possible, perplexity computations are performed 
#' anyway case, as the results might still be useful (e.g. to tune the model's 
#' parameters), even if their probabilistic interpretation does no longer hold.  
#' @examples
#' # Train 4-, 6-, and 8-gram models on Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing",
#' # compute their perplexities on the training and test corpora.
#' # We use Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" as test.
