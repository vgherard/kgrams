#' @param input a character vector.
#' @param EOS a regular expression matching an End-Of-Sentence delimiter.
#' @param keep_first TRUE or FALSE? Should the first character of the matches
#' be appended to the returned sentences (with a space)?
#' @return a character vector, each entry of which corresponds to a single
#' sentence.
#' @details
#' \code{tokenize_sentences()} splits text into sentences using a list of 
#' single character delimiters, specified by the parameter \code{EOS}. 
#' Specifically, when an EOS token is found, the next sentence begins at the
#' first position in the input string not containing any of the EOS tokens 
#' \emph{or white space} (so that entries like \code{"Hi there!!!"} or 
#' \code{"Hello . . ."} are both recognized as a single sentence).
#' 
#' If \code{keep_first} is \code{FALSE}, the delimiters are stripped off from 
#' the returned sequences, which means that all delimiters are treated 
#' symmetrically.
#' 
#' In the absence of any \code{EOS} delimiter, \code{tokenize_sentences()} 
#' returns the input as is, since parts of text corresponding to different 
#' entries of the input vector \code{x} are understood as parts of separate 
#' sentences.
