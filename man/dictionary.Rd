\arguments{
\item{object}{object from which to extract a dictionary, or to be coerced to
dictionary.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{size}{either \code{NULL} or a length one positive integer. Predefined size of the
required dictionary (the top \code{size} most frequent words are retained).}

\item{cov}{either \code{NULL} or a length one numeric between \code{0} and \code{1}.
Predefined text coverage fraction of the dictionary
(the most frequent words providing the required coverage are retained).}

\item{thresh}{either \code{NULL} or length one a positive integer.
Minimum word count threshold to include a word in the dictionary.}

\item{.preprocess}{a function taking a character vector as input and returning
a character vector as output. Optional preprocessing transformation
applied to text before creating the dictionary.}

\item{max_lines}{a length one positive integer or \code{Inf}.
Maximum number of lines to be read from the \code{connection}.
If \code{Inf}, keeps reading until the End-Of-File.}

\item{batch_size}{a length one positive integer less than or equal to
\code{max_lines}.Size of text batches when reading text from
\code{connection}.}

\item{x}{a \code{dictionary}.}
}
\value{
A \code{dictionary} for \code{dictionary()} and
\code{as_dictionary()}, a character vector for the \code{as.character()}
method.

\description{
Construct or coerce to and from a dictionary.
}
\details{
These generic functions are used to build \code{dictionary} objects,
or to coerce from other formats to \code{dictionary}, and from a
\code{dictionary} to a character vector. By now, the only
non-trivial type coercible to \code{dictionary} is \code{character},
in which case each entry of the input vector is considered as a single word.
Coercion from \code{dictionary} to \code{character} returns the list of
words included in the dictionary as a regular character vector.

Dictionaries can be extracted from \code{kgram_freqs} objects, or \emph{built}
from text coming either directly from a character vector or a connection to
textual input.

A single preprocessing transformation can be applied before processing the
text for unique words. After preprocessing,
\emph{anything delimited by one or more white space characters}
in the transformed text input \emph{is counted as a word} and may be added
to the dictionary modulo additional constraints.

The possible constraints for including a word in the dictionary can be of
three types: (i) fixed size of dictionary, implemented by the \code{size}
argument; (ii) fixed text covering fraction, as specified by the \code{cov}
argument; or (iii) minimum word count threshold, \code{thresh} argument.
\emph{Only one of these constraints can be applied at a time},
so that specifying more than one of \code{size}, \code{cov} or \code{thresh}
raises an error.

# Building a dictionary from Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing"

dict <- dictionary(much_ado)
length(dict)
query(dict, "leonato") # TRUE
query(dict, c("thy", "thou")) # c(TRUE, TRUE)
query(dict, "smartphones") # FALSE

# Getting list of words as regular character vector
words <- as.character(dict)
head(words)

# Building a dictionary from a list of words
dict <- as_dictionary(c("i", "the", "a"))
