\title{Query k-gram frequency tables or dictionaries}
\usage{
query(object, x)

\method{query}{kgram_freqs}(object, x)

\method{[}{kgram_freqs}(object, x)

\method{query}{kgrams_dictionary}(object, x)

\method{[}{kgrams_dictionary}(object, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{kgram_freqs} or \code{dictionary} class object.}

\item{x}{a character vector. A list of k-grams if \code{object} is of class
\code{kgram_freqs}, a list of words if \code{object} is a \code{dictionary}.}
}
\value{
an integer vector, containing k-gram counts of \code{x}, if
\code{object} is a \code{kgram_freqs} class object, a logical vector if
\code{object} is a \code{dictionary}. Vectorized over \code{x}.
}
\description{
Return the frequency count of k-grams in a k-gram frequency table, or
whether words are contained in a dictionary.
}
\details{
This generic has slightly different behaviors when querying
for the presence of words in a dictionary and for k-gram counts
in a frequency table respectively.
For words, \code{query()} looks for exact matches between the input and the
dictionary entries. Queries of Begin-Of-Sentence (\code{BOS()}) and
End-Of-Sentence (\code{EOS()}) tokens always return \code{TRUE}, and queries
of the Unknown-Word token return \code{FALSE}
(see \link[kgrams]{special_tokens}).

On the other hand, queries of k-gram counts first perform a word level
tokenization, so that anything separated by one or more space characters
in the input is considered as a single word (thus, for instance queries of
strings such as \code{"i love you"}, \code{" i love you"}), or
\code{"i love you "}) all produce the same outcome). Moreover,
querying for any word outside the underlying dictionary returns the counts
corresponding to the Unknown-Word token (\code{UNK()}) (e.g., if
the word \code{"prcsrn"} is outside the dictionary, querying
\code{"i love prcsrn"} is the same as querying
\code{paste("i love", UNK())}). Queries from k-grams of order \code{k > N}
will return \code{NA}.

The subsetting form \code{object[x]} is equivalent to
\code{query(object, x)}. The query of the empty string \code{""} returns the
total count of words, including the \code{EOS} and \code{UNK} tokens, but not
the \code{BOS} token.

See also the examples below.

\examples{
# Querying a k-gram frequency table
f <- kgram_freqs("a a b a b b a b", N = 2)
query(f, c("a", "b")) # query single words
query(f, c("a b")) # query a 2-gram
identical(query(f, "c"), query(f, "d"))  # TRUE, both "c" and "d" are <UNK>
identical(query(f, UNK()), query(f, "c")) # TRUE
query(f, EOS()) # 1, since text is a single sentence
f[c("b b", "b")] # query with subsetting synthax 
f[""] # 9 (includes the EOS token)

# Querying a dictionary
d <- as_dictionary(c("a", "b"))
query(d, c("a", "b", "c")) # query some words
query(d, c(BOS(), EOS(), UNK())) # c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
d["a"] query with subsetting synthax
